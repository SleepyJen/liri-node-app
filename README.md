# liri-node-app

There are two ways the program works. 
1. you can run the app in node without adding anything else, and a prompt will popup.
2. you can run the app in node with:
  node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>
  node liri.js spotify-this-song <song name here>
  node liri.js movie-this <movie name here>
  node liri.js do-what-it-says
